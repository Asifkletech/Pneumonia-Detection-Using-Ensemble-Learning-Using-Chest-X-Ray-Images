# Introduction
Pneumonia is a widespread and life-threatening respiratory infection that affects millions
of people worldwide. Timely and accurate detection of pneumonia plays a crucial role in
its management and treatment. Chest X-ray imaging is a commonly used diagnostic tool
for pneumonia due to its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. In recent yars, deep learning
techniques have shown remarkable performance in medical image analysis tasks, including pneumonia detection.This study investigates the effectiveness of three popular deep
learning architectures, namely ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet, in detecting pneumonia
from chestxrayimages. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach is explored to combine
the predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness. The aim is to
compare the performance of individual models and evaluate the potential benefits of ensemble learning in pneumonia detection. The study utilizes a publicly available dataset of
chest X-ray images, consisting of both pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative samples. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize the images for
improved model performance. The ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures are
trained independently on the dataset, leveraging transfer learning techniques to capitalize
on pre-trained models for improved convergence and generalization.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are used to assess the performance of each
model. The models are compared based on these metrics to determine their effectiveness
in pneumonia detection.
