# Pneumonia detection using ensemble learning using chest X-ray images
## Introduction
Pneumonia is a widespread and life-threatening respiratory infection that affects millions
of people worldwide. Timely and accurate detection of pneumonia plays a crucial role in
its management and treatment. 
Chest X-ray imaging is a commonly used diagnostic tool
for pneumonia due to its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. In recent yars, deep learning
techniques have shown remarkable performance in medical image analysis tasks, including pneumonia detection.
This study investigates the effectiveness of three popular deep
learning architectures, namely ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet, in detecting pneumonia
from chestxrayimages. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach is explored to combine
the predictions from multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness. 

The aim is to compare the performance of individual models and evaluate the potential benefits of ensemble learning in pneumonia detection. The study utilizes a publicly available dataset of
chest X-ray images, consisting of both pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative samples. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and normalize the images for
improved model performance. The ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures are
trained independently on the dataset, leveraging transfer learning techniques to capitalize
on pre-trained models for improved convergence and generalization.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are used to assess the performance of each
model. The models are compared based on these metrics to determine their effectiveness
in pneumonia detection.

## Objectives

* To develop a system that can accurately detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images.
* To compare the performance of different deep learning models (ResNet, MobileNetV2,
DenseNet) in terms of accuracy, sensitivity specificity and efficiency for pneumonia detection.
* To extract relevant features from chest X-ray images using the choosen deep learning
models to capture important patterns and characteristics associated with pneumonia.
* To utilize ensemble learning techniques to combine the predictions of multiple models
for improved accuracy and reliability in pneumonia detection.
* To assess the performance of the developed models and ensemble approach using metrics
like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall and F1 score.
* To generalize and Optimize: Ensure that the developed models and ensemble approach
can handle different datasets and real-world scenarios efficiently.
* To explore how the system can assist healthcare professionals, such as radiologists, in
making accurate and timely pneumonia diagnoses from chest X-ray images.

## Methodology

 The methodology of pneumonia detection using chest X-rays with ResNet, MobileNetV2,
DenseNet architectures, and ensemble learning, the following steps are followed. Firstly, a
dataset of chest X-ray images containing pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases is collected
and preprocessed to enhance image quality. Next, ResNet, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet
models are selected as deep learning architectures for pneumonia detection due to their
effectiveness in image classification tasks. 

Each model is then individually trained using
the preprocessed images, adjusting hyperparameters to optimize performance.
The trained models are evaluated using a validation set, considering accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. Ensemble learning techniques are applied to combine
the predictions of the individual models, and the ensemble model is evaluated to assess its
performance improvement. A comparison is made between the individual models and the
ensemble model to identify the most effective approach. 

The selected model or ensemble is further tested on an independent dataset to assess generalization ability.
The clinical applicability of the models is evaluated taking into account factors like computational efficiency and integration into healthcare systems. The results and analysis
of the experiments including performance metrics and insights gained are presented. By
following this methodology researchers aim to develop a robust and accurate system for
pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images with the potential to improve diagnostic
accuracy at early stage and patient care.
